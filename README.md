# MassDriver Landing Page Clone

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and leverages [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. 

## Purpose

This was created as part of the application process for [AllMind AI](https://allmindinvestments.com/), it is a clone of the [MassDriver](https://www.massdriver.cloud/) landing page. This project will not be used for distribution, commercial purposes, or any other unauthorized use.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
